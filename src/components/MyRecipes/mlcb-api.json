      "description": "There are two reasons for tossing the beef in cornstarch. First, it makes the steak crispy and caramelized on the outside. And second, it helps thicken the sauce. If you don't have any on hand (or you forgot to pick some up), feel free to skip it. But make sure to use it next time! (Rest assured, there will be a next time.)",
